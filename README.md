professional relationships. As we seek efficient and seamless ways to connect, a robust 
and versatile chat application is essential. We are excited to present a revolutionary 
proposal for a cutting-edge chat application that will redefine the way people interact in 
digital spaces.
• Our chat application stands out with its unique ability to facilitate communication 
between multiple users under the same server. Whether it's for a small team collaborating 
on a project, a global network of friends staying in touch, or a community looking to 
engage in meaningful conversations, our solution offers the ideal platform for real-time 
messaging.
• This proposal will delve into the features, functionality, and benefits of our chat

## Required Packages

1. Customer Tkinder
2. Socket Programming
3. Pillow

# Functions and Scope of the work

Our chat application can transfer messages using socket programming. All we need is the IPv4 
address of the user and our chat application will be able to build up a chat system for that user.
Before that, it is very important to build up a good server that listens to all the IP addresses that 
come and connect with the server. So, we must first get the server before asking users to come 
and interact with the system.
An admin can also review the IP address and the port number that they came and connected with 
the char system. Admin can also view the logs about the users and their conversations from the 
server point of view. Moreover, the admin can also see who joined and disconnected in real-time 
in the log section.
As for the users, they will be able to see the information that they share in their chat interface in 
real-time. Multiple users can come and connect with the server and start interacting with the 
chat. This type of chat system is very useful for decentralized farms or group projects. People 
can stay under the same network and work. The most important thing is that they must share the 
same network and if they are on different networks, they won’t be able to connect to the server 
and able to chat.
